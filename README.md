# SKILLTUBE
YouTube has world-class educational content, but it is unstructured, distracting, and optimized for watch time , not learning. SKILLTUBE is an open-source platform that organizes high-demand skills into structured learning paths (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced) using the best educational content, without distractions.

#SkillTube fixes this by curating **only learning-focused content** and organizing it by difficulty level.

##  Features

- Structured skill paths (Beginner → Advanced)
- Checkbox-based progress tracking

  ##  Tech Stack 

- Python (Flask)
- HTML / CSS
- GitHub for version control

  ##  Vision

SkillTube aims to become a free, structured learning layer on top of the internet helping students build real skills instead of wasting time.

##  Contributing

This project is open-source. Contributions, ideas, and feedback are welcome.
